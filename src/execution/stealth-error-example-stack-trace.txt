This is a real example stack trace with no automation.
Threw an error by overriding document.querySelector. 
When a function from app.js used document.querySelector 
it logs the following stack trace.
Error: Bot Error
    at myBotCheck (test2.html:6:27)
    at HTMLDocument.querySelector (test2.html:14:25)
    at plop1 (app.js:3:24)
    at plop2 (app.js:7:5)
    at plop3 (app.js:11:5)

This is an example stack trace when using playwright with "page.evaluate()":
Error: Detection Error

This is an example stack trace when using playwright with "page.$$eval()":

How we will modify the stack trace:
A.) Before script is first evaluated by v8 engine, we will replace the script name with our custom identifier.
    The identifier will serve 2 purposes:
        - it tells us that this is a CDP script and should have it's stack trace modified 
        - it tells us which lines correspond to our CDP script and should be modified

B.) Remove all lines that contain our identifier.

C.) We'll add between 1 and 5 new lines (random number of lines). Random function names of random length.
    Random line numbers. Always app.js as file name for now. Doesn't seem like that's enough 
    of an identifier to use as a signal.
